# Advent of Code 2017

# License

Just don't do stupid things, m'kay?

# Usage

Every folder contains the tasks for the day of December indicated by the number alongside the AoC_ prefix. Every day is a seperate C# executable project.

# Day 2 tasks

The day 2 tasks feature a text file that I named "input.txt". This file has to be in the same directory as the executable as it contains the input (there is really no reason to use the command line as input anymore...). If you don't put it there, you know how it goes, boom goes the program. Also, you can change this input how you wish, but I can't guarantee it works for any input at all, at least make sure it fits the day 2 tasks.

# Day 4 tasks

The same things that apply to the day 2 tasks apply to this task as well.
